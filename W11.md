# Windows11 edition
It is a major version of the Windows operating system developed by Microsoft, using the Windows NT kernel in version 10. Windows 11 was announced during the Microsoft Event on June 24, 2021.
Windows 11 is available as a free upgrade to compatible devices4 under Windows 10 through Windows Update5,6,7, but also for Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1 systems. The deployment of the upgrade to Windows 11 begins on October 5, 20218 (for new devices) and continues until 2022 (for compatible devices), according to various Microsoft announcements.
Windows 11 is the successor to Windows 10, released in 20159.

## Development
Sun Valley Project
Windows 11 was not an expected release because, when Windows 10 was released, Microsoft had claimed that this operating system would be the last Windows and would be continually updated10. Microsoft had therefore announced a major update to the Windows 10 interface, and not a new operating system.
However, several clues from June 2021 and until June 24, 2021 suggested that it was not an update of Windows 10 that was being prepared, but a new version of Windows: Windows 11, whose name code is Sun Valley or SV11.

## Towards a “new generation of Windows”
At the Microsoft Build 2021 developer conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hinted that a new version of Microsoft's operating system could be released soon12,13.
A week later, Microsoft began sending out invitations to a Microsoft Event dedicated to Windows, scheduled for June 24.
A week before the event, on June 15, photos and a beta version of the system attributed by many to the American firm were leaked on Chinese forums14, revealing the new design of the operating system and new functions and applications, such as the return of widgets. The system's user interface looks very similar to that of the canceled Windows 10X15 project.
A disk image of a developer version of Windows 11 dating from May 30, 2021 leaked, allowing its installation before a possible official release date. The authenticity of this disk image was confirmed by Microsoft, which even asked Google to no longer index on its search engine all sites offering the disk image for download.

## Announcement
During the Microsoft Event, Panos Panay, director of the Windows branch at Microsoft, confirmed that this new system would indeed be called Windows 1116.
The event presents the “next generation of Windows”. Then Microsoft employees intervene, each presenting more precisely a new feature of Windows 11 (multitasking, Microsoft Teams, tablet mode, touch screen, video games, etc.). Finally, Satya Nadella takes the floor, recalling what Windows has been “always”, all the possibilities offered by the operating system.
