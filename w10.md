Windows 10 is an operating system in the Windows NT family developed by the American company Microsoft. Officially presented on September 30, 2014, it has been publicly available since July 29, 2015. Although the system is called Windows 10, it is version NT 6.4 for versions up to the "Technical Preview", the first version of Windows NT 6 being Windows Vista. Windows 10 is thus a final version of Windows NT 6.0; nevertheless, since the final version, it does indeed bear the internal number 10 instead of 6.4. It is the successor to Windows 8.1.

At the Build 2015 conference which took place from April 29 to May 1 in San Francisco, Microsoft announced that the replacement for Internet Explorer, previously known as Project Spartan, would be called Microsoft Edge. In addition, Microsoft has given many details on the creation of applications for Windows 10 which will be available on PCs, smartphones and tablets (including the Surface Hub), as well as on Xbox One consoles and on the Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality headset . Applications developed for Windows 10 are now called “Universal Windows Apps” (UWP).

A version suitable for nomadic use, Windows 10 Mobile, is also available for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices with ARM processors and whose screen is less than eight inches. Tablets and hybrids larger than eight inches must have a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture and run Windows 10 for PC.

For the first time since its creation in 1985, Windows is offered on a USB key during purchase.

In order to encourage users to quickly migrate their computers to this new operating system, an advertising program (GWX.exe), available through update KB3035583 since June 1, 2015, is placed in the notification area to Pro and Home editions (except Enterprise) of Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 systems. Additionally, this program regularly opens windows or even forces the upgrade without user consent, and removing this program requires certain skills. This free offer was valid until July 29, 2016 at 12 a.m. (French time). However, despite what was announced, the upgrade to Windows 10 still remains free today for users with an old Windows license.

Microsoft provides users with a website summarizing the history of Windows 103 updates.

The end of support for Windows 10 is scheduled for October 14, 2025. Its successor, Windows 11, has been available since October 5, 2021.
