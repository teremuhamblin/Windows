# Windows7: Microsoft edition

At the beginning of August 2014, Microsoft announced the end of standard support for Windows 7 for January 13, 2015; however, the extended support remained valid until January 14, 202017. This very quickly sparked a real flow of controversy on the web from Internet users, who mainly use this support around the world18. Intel's Skylake and Kaby Lake processors were not initially supported on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 forcing users to get Windows 1019. An update enabled support for Skylake devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.120.

For large organizations that need longer support from Microsoft, it is possible to purchase an "ESU" (Extended Security Updates) kit to extend the support period by one year, renewable 3 times. It was therefore possible to continue using Windows 7 updated until January 2023.

Embedded POSReady 7, and Embedded Standard 7 have extended support as well.

Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020. Since that date, Microsoft no longer offers new operating system updates or security patches for this version of Windows, but Microsoft decides to leave updates updated for its Microsoft Security Essential antivirus until 2023.
